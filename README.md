# askides/ui

Extensible React component library built with TailwindCSS.

## Foreword

This library was created as a result of a side project I built to experiment
with some features and it contains a collection of **reusable** React components
for **fast development** and **almost zero lock-in**.

Please note that this is **not** a packaged component library served with an npm
package. Instead, you can simply _copy and paste_ the components into your
project to start using them immediately.

## Credits

Before we dive into the details, i would like to give credit to
[@shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn) for his
[excellent work](https://ui.shadcn.com), which has been a great source of
inspiration for this component library.
