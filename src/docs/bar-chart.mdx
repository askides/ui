## Anatomy

Here's how the component can be composed.

```tsx
() => (
  <BarChart>
    <BarChartColumn />
  </BarChart>
);
```

To ensure the highest flexibility, the chart renders rows as children so you can
decide to loop through a list or put the rows manually. There is a utility I
made called `createSmoothValues` to help the developer create a smoother array
of values to ensure the placeholder will be always nice to see.
