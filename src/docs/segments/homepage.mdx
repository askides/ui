title: Getting Started
description: Learn how to use this library and start creating.
---

That library was created as a result of a side project I built to experiment
with some features and it contains a collection of **reusable** React components
for **fast development** and **almost zero lock-in**.

Please note that this is **not** a packaged component library served with an npm
package. Instead, you can simply _copy and paste_ the components into your
project to start using them immediately.

## Credits

Before we dive into the details, i would like to give credit to
[@shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn) for his
[excellent work](https://ui.shadcn.com), which has been a great source of
inspiration for this component library.

## Prerequisites

Although you can easily repurpose them, all the examples you will find are made
with [React](https://react.dev/), and use
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

So before using the components, in addition to the two dependencies already
mentioned, you need to ensure that you have the following dependencies installed
in your project:

- _clsx_: A tiny utility for constructing class names in JavaScript.
- _tailwind-merge_: A utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes.
- _class-variation-authority_: A library for managing class variations in
  components.

## Usage

Each component will have a preview available that will allow you to see the
result immediately, and a small toggle to view its anatomy. Something like this:

<Preview example="button-default" vn="Primary" />

You will also always find on each page, a section containing a link to the
component's source code that you can copy and paste for your own development.

## Contribution

This library is used primarily for my indie projects, and will be enriched, as I
go along with new components, that said if you find a bug or have any
interesting ideas, feel free to open a PR on GitHub, or write me on Twitter!
